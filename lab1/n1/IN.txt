Memories broken
The truth goes unspoken
I’ve even forgotten my name

I don’t know the season
Or what is the reason
I’m standing here holding my blade

A desolate place ( place )
Without any trace ( trace )
It’s only the cold wind I feel

It’s me that I spite
As I stand up and fight
The only thing I know for real

There will be blood -shed
The man in the mirror nods his head

The only one-left
Will run up upon the dragon’s back

Because the mountains don’t give back what they take
Oh no
There will be blood ( blood )-shed ( shed )
It’s the only thing I’ve ever known

Losing my identity
Wondering have I gone insane
To find the truth in front of me
I must climb this mountain range
Looking downward from this deadly height
And never realizing why I fight
